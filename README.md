# Reproduction NuxtLayout component not used

1. Install dependencies. (I've used pnpm)
2. Start the app using `pnpm dev`
3. Restart laptop (I'm using Windows)

**One other note. Not sure if related**

When adding a new component my PyCharm IDE doesn't recognize that new component's auto import 
When using in another place after that it does somehow recognize it. This behavior is consistent 
everywhere in the app (layouts, pages and other components)
